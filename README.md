iTunes-Library-Checker
======================

The **iTunes Library Checker** reads your iTunes Library file *~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music Library.xml* and checks if the corresponding files actually exist on your disk.

# Usage
Run

	./itunes_library_checker.rb

There are no command line options available (yet).

## Troubleshooting
Make sure you have the *Plist* gem installed.
